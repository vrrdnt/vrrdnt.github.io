this makes it easy to run servers only built for windows, which is nice.\nmodded notes always use a start script or docker image with the right flags most modpacks (atm, ftb, etc.) use forge or fabric server ram: minimum 6–8gb for large packs keep max-tick-time=-1 for debugging long tick hangs log monitoring helps (multilog, journalctl, etc.) pros and cons summary option pros cons ovh cheap, powerful old ui, bad support digitalocean fast deploy, clean ui not good for modded, expensive cpu aws ec2 flexible, scalable expensive, billing is confusing home server full control, no fees uptime, noise, power, manual upkeep closing thoughts if you want full control and already run other services, self-host. if you want convenience and a clean ui, use digitalocean or ovh. if you\u0026rsquo;re managing multiple servers or users, pterodactyl/pelican is worth the setup. docker is ideal for isolation and repeatability. keep backups automated, monitor performance, and version-lock mods.\n","title":"minecraft server hosting"}]
